# Is this the carbon atom you are looking for? -AI to predict CNTâ€™s atomic coordination

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are newly discovered nanomaterials that have unique properties.Their properties are influenced by their shape and structure, so modeling and simulating their structure plays an important role for scientists to try new synthesis methods. Simulating the CNTs currently takes a lot of time as mathematical calculations are needed to be done for accurate atomic coordinates. Artificial Neural Networks can be applied to predict atomic coordinates, accelerating the iterations on simulation software.
